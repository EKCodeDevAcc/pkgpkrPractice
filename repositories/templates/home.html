              <h3>Why Package Picker?</h3>
              <p>Modern applications rely heavily on OSS packages. So how do you find good ones? Search engines only know what you tell them, and humans can't keep track of the millions of OSS packages available.</p>
              <p>Our approach is to instead look at the dependencies in your application. We feed these to a machine learning algorithm, which recommends packages that are tailored to your specific application.</p>
